@pple$ What admin work do you intend to take part in?\n$A: Resolving backlogs in various XfDs is what I intend to do if I\u2019m entrusted with administrative tools. In fact, as my unavoidably limited time for Wikipedia (I admit that my erratic edits may not satisfy the community) may be a hindrance to the complete devotion, I will mainly keep strict eyes on old AFDs and WP:CFD/W, two fields that I\u2019m mostly active on though my experience is not as fertile as I\u2019d like to be. I would be also glad to assist with Wikipedia:Request an account and candidates for speedy deletion.
^demon_2$ What sysop chores do you anticipate helping with? Please check out Category:Administrative backlog, and read the page about administrators and the administrators' reading list.\n$A: I want the tools to serve the needs of the community, wherever they need me to serve. Personally, I would prefer to concentrate my work on TFD and EPP. However, if the community needs me to come forward and deal with AE/AER, I will not be afraid to step forward and get my hands dirty. I believe blocks should only be handed out sparingly, and in situations where polite warning would have no positive effect. However, banning should be considered most severe, and should only be handed out by the will of the ArbCom, Jimbo, or the community at large. Finally, as MedCom chair, I will, as a sysop, never perform any action that could potentially damage the committee's repute.
^demon_3$ Why did you resign your sysop rights, and why did you decline to reacquire them in the standard way?\n$"<dl><dd><b>A.</b>I resigned my sysop rights for multiple reasons. First and foremost, I was entirely too busy and unable to dedicate myself in the fashion I formerly did. Additionally, at the time, I felt myself becoming more and more distant to the community, and saw my participation here coming slowly to an end. I declined to reaquire them in the standard methods to avoid such a decision being \""on a whim,\"" if you will. However, I have thought long and hard since that event, and I wish to slowly begin re-participating in the meta-aspects of the English Wikipedia, and I believe my regaining sysop permissions is an extension of that.</dd></dl>"
0xDeadbeef$ Why are you interested in becoming an administrator?\n$A: I would like to help out in administrative areas, specifically administrator intervention against vandalism, speedy deletion, and other backlogs should a need arise.In relation to the work that I have already been doing as a non-admin, I have on multiple occasions found having the tools would help by reducing effort or work that is required of other editors: While triaging false positive reports for edit filters, I'd often come across clear cases of WP:NOTHERE accounts that warrant a block right away. I have also occasionally seen deleted revisions being brought up on requests for edit filters where being able to view them would have helped with implementing those requests quicker.
2over0$ In what administrative work do you intend to take part?\n$A: Working through New admin school and the Administrators' reading list for starters, obviously. I devote a fairly significant portion of my time to this project, and would like to see it succeed in the long term; I see cleaning out areas of Category:Administrative backlog and Category:Wikipedia requests related to admins such as AN3, RFPP, AIV, {{editprotected}}, &c. as one way to help ensure that it does. Special:Unwatchedpages also needs more attention, pretty much by definition. I am not sure if it is just that I have been noticing such things since making a bid for the mop'n'bucket has been on my mind, but lately it seems that there have been more frequent posts to AN reporting backlogs. I have closed several non-controversial AfD discussions, and I think I have a workable understanding of consensus-building, parsing policy-based arguments, and ignoring disruptive sockpuppets. I take a conservative view of speedy deletions, both as is due a low-oversight occupation and because nothing drives away a constructive first-timer like coming back from dinner to find that their work has disappeared.
5_albert_square$ What administrative work do you intend to take part in?\n$A: Primarily, I will ask experienced admins (I have a number of admin friends that I could turn to, including Anemone Projectors, H J Mitchell and Courcelles) if I'm unsure whether or not I should deploy an admin function.  I would expect the use of my tools to be mainly dealing with vandalism (page protection, reversion of obvious vandalism, protection of articles when necessary etc) and moving pages over redirect when necessary.  An example of what I would deem obvious vandalism and would protect a page, can be found in the revision histories of Adam Sandler and Snoopy.  With Snoopy, various IPs kept adding that he attended a High School in Connecticut.  Because it was more than one IP I requested protection of the article.  Adam Sandler is a BLP that has come under numerous vandalism attacks in the past, from various editors making inappropriate remarks such as this. This is what I would consider obvious vandalism.  I would also help with dealing with the backlogs at WP:RFPP and WP:AIV, indeed at the moment I offer support at AIV if there's a backlog by doing things like checking user pages to see if they've been appropriately warned and checking user contributions to see if their edits are actually vandalism.  If the user for example has not been warned sufficiently and/or the edits aren't vandalism I will always post a note on AIV stating that I've found this.
7_2$ What administrative work do you intend to take part in?\n$A: Primarily AIV, UAA, and RPP tasks, as well as helping out with any other administrative backlogs.  Pages tagged with more time-sensitive CSD tags (such as {{db-attack}} and {{db-copyvio}} would also rank high on the to-do list.
23skidoo$ What sysop chores, if any, would you anticipate helping with? (Please read the page about administrators and the administrators' reading list.)\n$A. I need to do a bit more research on that. Probably many of the same things I've been working on in the past. 23skidoo 00:39, 1 October 2005 (UTC)[reply]
