RadioKirk$1$What sysop chores, if any, would you anticipate helping with? Please check outCategory:Wikipedia backlog, and read the page aboutadministratorsand theadministrators' reading list.$ Short-term, I would probably limit my privileges to removal of nonsensical (or offensive) image revisions (to make their reversion more difficult) and the temporary blocking of vandals, within guidelines and probably after discussion. I would not expect to impose an immediate block unless I caught someone in the middle of vandalism en masse.
RadioKirk$1$Of your articles or contributions to Wikipedia, are there any about which you are particularly pleased, and why?$ While researchingJulie Andrews' page, I noticed there was no page for actressKaren Dotrice, so I researched and wrote it. Immediately afterwards, I researched and expanded the article for her co-star,Matthew Garber. Previously, I had done the same forScott WeingerandDakota Fanning(I tend to do these as I spot them). I've also researched and added (or, in some cases, purged) data forWilliam Shatner,Lindsay Lohan,Emma Watson,Johnny Carsonand a handful of others.
RadioKirk$1$Have you been in any conflicts over editing in the past or do you feel other users have caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future?$ I've discussed disagreements in style or data, but no conflicts of which I'm aware. Should it happen, I would make every effort to be civil; however, I'm not above the occasionalpejorative phrase[grin].
RadioKirk$2$What sysop chores, if any, would you anticipate helping with? Please check outCategory:Wikipedia backlog, and read the page aboutadministratorsand theadministrators' reading list.$I would not jump in and make any huge changes over what I'm doing now. As a start, I would expect that I would block the more persistent vandals that I'm reporting now; then, as I become more familiar with the tools, I would probably toe-first into backlogs and mediations, growing as gradually then as I have until now.
RadioKirk$2$Of your articles or contributions to Wikipedia, are there any about which you are particularly pleased, and why?$Aside from my persistence in fighting vandals' persistence, I'm particularly happy with my work on three articles:Lindsay Lohanwhich, with the help ofpeer reviewand theFACprocess during a massive rewrite, was a huge experience- and confidence-builder as it becamefeatured;Karen Dotrice, a featured article only five weeks after I'd created it; and,Ike Altgens, created and improved togood articlestatus in three days (I'm still hunting for more background info before I go to FAC).
RadioKirk$2$Have you been in any conflicts over editing in the past or do you feel other users have caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future?$"Yes,here. In the beginning,user:Backburner001completely convinced me that he believed \""be bold\"" meant \""my way or the highway\"", and that he was being less than honest when he said he wanted the instant data improved (as opposed to \""gone altogether\""). Eventually, it worked out, as I rather expected it might. More importantly, we were perfectlycivilin aseparate discussionduring the dispute; it is important to me that I try to consider each discussion to be a separate and distinct entity, even those occurring with someone with whom I may have a dispute."
RadioKirk$2$"What do you understand the abbreviation ""nn-bio"" to mean, in full?Stifle(talk)00:36, 29 April 2006 (UTC)"$I believe that's non-notable biography and, if memory serves, I've dealt with a couple. (Edit: Actually, I'm sure of it. I've caught a few using VandalProof that I nom'ed for speedies because they were painfully obvious, and I remember one [Edit: now two] that I actually researched before nom'ing.)RadioKirktalk to me02:09, 29 April 2006 (UTC)[reply]
Rami R$1$What administrative work do you intend to take part in?$"I intend to be a 'general use' admin, helping where I can, and with backlogs as needed. Specifically I've noticed I am often active during the \""quieter\"" times of the day, when AIV reports may not be taken care of as promptly as they typically are. I also intend to be (semi-)active in UAA, RFPP, and speedy deletions, but mostly only for blatant/simple cases (e.g. at RFPP I don't see myself imposing full-protection). Perhaps as I gain experience I'll deal with more complicated issues."
Rami R$1$What are your best contributions to Wikipedia, and why?$I consider myself a wiki-gnome. As such, I'm afraid I don't have any FA/GA/DYK I can proudly point to (truly I envy those with the patience to work on an article from creation to FA). I do have some copyediting work, adding sources here and there, and vandalism removal. I also do various meta-editing, such as talk and talk-archive page maintenance. Specifically I'm proud of maintainingTalk:Jerusalem/capital- an archive of discussions having do to with Jerusalem and its status as capital. In terms of article creations, I have one stub (Eliezer Rivlin- Israeli supreme court justice) and two main article splits. I've also created a number of redirects.
Rami R$1$Have you been in any conflicts over editing in the past or have other users caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future?$Despite working on the heated topic of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for the most part I usually avoid conflicts. Not to say that I haven't had any. I've learned from these that most editors can be reasoned with when engaged in a calm and respectful manner. However, not all conflicts end with everyone happy, and in such cases it's important to just drop the issues and move on.
Rami R$1$Could you please answer the following questions related to CSDs:$"a.In your own words, could you explain the difference betweenCSD A1andCSD A3?\nA1 is an article lacking context, meaning an average reader would not be able to recognize/understand what the topic is about. e.g.\""John Doe has a nice car.\""However,\""John Doe, born 1966, has a nice car. He currently serves as postman for Springfield, Wisconsin.\""Has context, and thus not a A1 candidate (doesn't meet other inclusion criteria though).\nA3 is about the article content. While external link can be used to establish context (e.g. in an article about \""Fake Industries Co.\"" a link to the 'about' section in their website), wikipedia is not the yellow pages, and articles should have at least a proper summery of the topic.\nb.In your own words, could you explain what would cause you todeclinea request for a speedy deletion using criteriaA7?\nAt first I would check if the article is even within the scope of A7: real person, individual animal(s), an organization, or web content. Once it is established that it is, I would check for a semi-credible assertion of notablity. E.g. something on lines of\""Has won ... awards\"", \""well-known/famous for ...\"", \""achieved ...\"", etc. Semi-credible in this case means that it isn't glaringly obvious that claim is fake; so\""Jane Doe is thefastest person in the world\""would not do (although technically that would be G3 material).\nAfter declining, I would of course take the necessary step to insure it meets our inclusion criteria (if needed), or have it deleted in the proper process (other CSD if applicable, prod/afd, etc.)"
Rami R$1$"You have been editing an articleArticle-1, adding information, sorting out layout, etc. Another editor (editor-123) reverts some of your edits, with the edit summary ""removing of unsourced information"". How do you deal with this, which admin tools (page protection, page deletion, blocking, etc) or other methods you would use to deal with it, and which policies/guidelines/essays you would use in justification?"$Given that I am involved, I can of course not use any of my admin tools. I would try to discuss said edits see if our differences can be resolved. Failing that, other dispute resolution step exist, including 3O (assuming we are the only two arguing), RFC, medcab and so forth. However, not all differences can be settled happily, and not all users can be reasoned with. If there is a clear edit war going on, I may make aWP:ANEWreport or request protection.
Rami R$1$If you were to close an AFD, on aBLP, (such asthis), where there is no easily determined consensus how would you close it?$"I would definitely not close such AFDs, as (a) I don't plan to be active at AFD closures, and (b) it's one thing making a tough call, it's something else placing your head on the executioner's block.\nHypothetically, if I were required to make such a close, I'd try to avoid making a \""no consensus\"" call. Though the easiest call to make, for a contentious issue such as marginally-notable BLPs an admin should take the extra effort to make a \""consensus\"" call (be it keep or delete), even if borderline. Not to say that a borderline consensus can always be found, just that if it can be, it should be.\nAs for the example, even hypothetically I wouldn't close it. As the article was about a wikipedia editor, determining the AFD consensus (or lack of) was made impossible for those not \""well versed\"" in the wiki-political issues surrounding said editor. I suppose the proper thing to do, would be to ask oneself how would the AFD look like if it wasn't a wiki-editor being discussed, and this is a question I cannot answer."
Rami R$1$What in your opinion is the worst BLP issue at the moment, and what would you do to resolve it using your admin tools?$"I don't believe there is a \""worst\"" BLP issue. But there is a big problem with how the community handles \""issues\"", including BLP-related, newbie treatment, BADSITES, and (to a certain extent) the classic inclusionism vs deletionism. On one side you have editors claiming that the issue is a \""make or break\"" problem for Wikipedia, and on the other side, you have editors who refuse to even acknowledge that the issue exists. Such a clash of stances creates a hostile editing environment, leading to blocks, bans and burnout of good editors. I don't have a solution for this. As far as I can tell, this is Wikipedia's modus operandi."
Rami R$1$What measures do you think Wikipedia should take to protectpersonally identifiable informationabout editors that are under the age of majority, and how will you deal with such cases as an admin?$Depends on what PII includes. If it's just a name, I don't believe much is needed other than just recommending to the editor to omit his name (or even have it deleted). But if it further includes contact info (such as an address or phone number) or other clearly private info (birth date, school, etc.), such info should be deleted andsuppressed, and the editor warned against reposting said info.
Rami R$1$"Say we have an in-arguably notable porn actress from the 1960s who is still alive today.  No known public domain pictures of her are known to exist and she is known to not be interested in having pictures taken of her.  A user has posted a (clothed) full-body picture of the actress from a 1960's magazine arguing that even if a picture of her could be taken today, it wouldn't represent the ""characteristics"" for which she is notable.  It is taken to FfD where 2 admins argue it is replaceable and 3 other users argue that any picture would be hard to get and the characteristics issue is valid.  How do you close it and why?Hobit(talk)13:25, 4 March 2010 (UTC)"$I'd like to state that, as unlikely it is that I will close AFDs, it is even more unlikely that I'll close FFDs. XFDs in general aren't really my cup of tea. I've participated on a few which I came across and found interesting, but it's not one of my main interests in wikipedia.\nIn this hypothetical case, it is generally accepted that non-free images of living people cannot be used, other than exceptional circumstances such as uniqueness of time or context which cannot be reproduced. It is a legitimate question, whether a picture of the actress from her 'active' years falls under this exception. With less than 4 arguers on each side, I feel that the question hasn't been sufficiently explored, and would opt to 're-list' the discussion, if that is an option at FFD (I've only once participated in an FFD, if I recall correctly). If I do not have this option (hypothetically or not) I would close it as keep. A widely published, clothed picture (I'm assuming it's widely published as it's a magazine scan) from 40-50 years ago does not pose a significant BLP problem to override the discussion, which is leaning to keep. As I stated in q6, for BLP-related issues I'd rather find borderline consensus than none at all.\nLet me emphasize again that this answer is purely hypothetical, and is hypothetical in each of it's phases: I would close the discussion only if I had to, and as 'keep' only if I couldn't re-list.
Rami R$1$What's your take on IAR?$AIAR is an important policy on Wikipedia, a guiding principle which keeps us building and improving the encyclopedia, and not just following rules for the sake of following rules. However, IAR is also too often abused. Ideally, IAR should only invoked retroactively, before being made aware of the rule-breaking. If one knows in advance of a problem in a rule, one should first work  to change said rule. In my opinion, more important than IAR, is using commonsense and keeping in mind consensus. If you invoke IAR against consensus, you need to ask yourself if you really are improving the encyclopedia. The consensus-building model on which Wikipedia operates, though far from perfect (see q7), is what brought us to where we are today. And undermining that model can never to said to be clearly improving the encyclopedia.
Rami R$2$What administrative work do you intend to take part in?$I intend to help with administrative backlogs as needed. Specifically AIV, RFPP, and UA
Rami R$2$What are your best contributions to Wikipedia, and why?$I think my most significant contribution would berfppClerk, a clerking script for RFPP, the most commonly used cleaning method for RFPP in use today. Another contribution I'm proud of is maintainingTalk:Jerusalem/capital, a collection of discussions regarding Jerusalem and its status as capital. Article writing isn't my exactly my best skill, but I do know how it's done: I've polished upJerusalem bulldozer attackto GA status, and created one stub article (Eliezer Rivlin).
Rami R$2$Have you been in any conflicts over editing in the past or have other users caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future?$"Israeli politics naturally isn't the easiest topic to handle, and stressful situation do arise frequently. For the most part, I've learned not to take conflicts to heart too much. Wikipedia isn't a race and there's no deadline.\nDuring my \""formative years\"" here on Wikipedia I didn't handle disputes too well, escalating disputes and being too strict in my interpretation of policies, when I should have been more patient. Since then I believe I've learned the decorum expected of a Wikipedian, and more importantly why. (Also, I continually learn the insufficiency in template warnings, despite their convenience)"
Rami R$2$To what extent would you consider yourself to be aninvolved administratorin respect of editorial and user conduct disputes related to the Israel-Arab-Palestinian conflict? What would that mean in practice for your use of the tools in such disputes?$The conflict is a significant interest of mine, both on Wikipedia and off. As an Israeli I have vested interest. While I try my best to maintain neutrality and act in an unbiased way, I can't completely disconnect emotionally. As such I consider myself involved when it comes to the conflict, and will not take administrative actions in related disputes (except for dealing with  blatant vandalism, etc.).
Rami R$2$Since June 2010 you have averaged about 60 edits per month, made 1 UAA report, and 1 protection request to RFPP. Since you expressed interest in working in these two areas, do you foresee yourself being more active both in these areas, and on Wikipedia in general, if given the tools?$Yes. The past half year hasn't been the most stress-free in my life, especially the past three months with what's shaping to be my last semester of BSc studies. During that time when I was on Wikipedia, I didn't spend much time patrolling, thus specifically the reduced admin-noticeboards activity. But now with the semester behind me, all tests completed, and various other issues resolved, I expect to have much more time available for Wikipedia, at least for the near future.\nSpecifically re RFPP: working on rfppClerk means relatively frequent readings of the RFPP page. So I am pretty confident regarding the protection policy and practices. Alas, reading a noticeboard doesn't generate proven experience.
Rami R$2$Could you please provide examples of inadequate reports toWP:AIV(that you would decline and remove from that page without blocking the user reported)?$An ip user who hasn't been warned recently, or hasn't vandalized after a level 3 or 4 warning (or a recent release from a block). Users who aren't engaged in vandalism (e.g. edit-warring or pov-pushing; may defer to ANI for such cases). Stale cases. This is what comes to mind right now, I'm sure there's more reasons.
Rami R$2$When is it acceptable to block a user without giving him or her any warnings? Do you think the current four-warning system too strict, too lenient, or just right?$Blocking without issuing a warning first is acceptable when the user's disruption is unquestionably bad faith (e.g. blatant vandalism) and is severe to the point where leaving the user unblocked would cause the encyclopedia significant damage (e.g. page move vandalism). That's the general case. In addition there are special cases, such as legal threats and sock-puppetry.\nThe four level warning system is good as it allows response flexibility. However, many editors are somewhat strict in applying all of them, even when it's clear the vandal is not going to stop. I suspect this even encourages the vandal to continue, as it builds up curiosity to see the next level (anyone played Warcraft here? remember clicking on the soldiers just to hear their response?).
Rami R$2$What would be your criteria for blocking a user atWP:AIVand protecting a page atWP:RfPP?$AIV: the reported user has vandalized (or spammed) after a recent level 3 or 4 warning or after being recently released from a block. (recent being a less significant factor for registered users). Warnings may not be necessary for cases which are both blatant and severe (see q7).\nSemi at RFPP: cases of ip/newly registered user disruption which cannot be feasibly countered via blocks. As arule of thumb: at least 3 vandals in the past 24 hours, or a vandal a day in the past week, where the disruption by ips/newly registered outweighs the constructive edits by ips/newly registered.\nFull at RFPP: a multi-party edit war, where the edit war can't be stopped by blocking just one or two users. Also high-risk templates (templates that are transcluded across many pages, so vandalism there would have a much wider effect than just the template).
Rami R$2$At your last RfA, you indicated that you would not be closing deletion discussions if you became an administrator.  Has this changed?$Nope, no change. XFD participation in general isn't really my cup of tea.
Rami R$2$You have said that you wish to work atWP:RFPP. It is a common occurence that an editor involved in an edit war will make his third revert and then attempt to game the system by quickly making a request for full protection. How would you deal with such a request?$3RR is not an entitlement, but rather a hard limit. As such, the gaming editor may have his own contributions inspected, and may be warned or blocked accordingly. Also, protection, like blocking, is generally only used as a preventative measure, when there is clear evidence of its need. Therefor the request itself may be denied if the reporting editor did not take reasonable steps to avoid the edit-war (such as talk page participation), casting doubt as to the necessity of protecting the article.
Rami R$2$If there was one thing you could change about Wikipedia (a new policy, or a new guideline, or something else entirely, for instance), what would it be, and why?$ It's a tough question, one I don't think I can answer. While there are many problems in Wikipedia, such as how we choose our admins (sorry RFA participants); how we handle civil pov-pushers; and how we handle long standing content disputes (just look atTalk:Jerusalem/capital, something clearly isn't working), I don't have a solution to these issues. I suspect there aren't any simple solutions, and ultimately it comes down to deeper questions, on how we wish to continue as a project.
Rami R$2$How would you handle the following scenario.  Editor A complains that Editor B is wikihounding him.  A review of their interactions reveals: a) heated differences of view in the past; and b) a number of instances of Editor B appearing at obscure articles that Editor A has edited, and editing in a manner that can be anticipated to upset Editor A (reverts, challenging every unreferenced sentence, etc.).  Editor B maintains he is simply editing withing wikipedia's guidelines, and denies the wikihounding charge.$ The question of when does proper editing stop and hounding begin isn't an easy one. On the one hand, inspection of an editors contributions is not only allowed, it is even encouraged in some cases in order to find and take care of problematic editing. On the other hand, an editor intentionally antagonizing another editor by following their edits is not only rude, but disallowed by policy. Often issues become intermixed, bad behavior and bad faith from all sides breeding more bad behavior and bad faith from all sides.\nAnalyzing and determining where faults lie is no simple feat for a lone admin, especially when reports of this nature tend to devolve rather quickly, allowing only glimpses into the actual issues. A RFCU may be beneficial, allowing easier assessment. Eventual solutions may involve a topic ban, an interaction ban, or simple warning once the facts are set straight.\nSo back to the question of what I would do: if the situation is clear enough, I'd warn the relevant editors, or propose a topic/interaction ban for community consideration. If the situation isn't clear though, I may press for clarifications or suggest a RFCU.
