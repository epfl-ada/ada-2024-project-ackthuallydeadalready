# Factors influencing voter behaviour in Wikipedia Request for Adminship Elections

## Abstract

The Wikipedia environment has many types of user accounts that have access to different functionalities to fulfill different roles. One of these roles is administrators, which have high and broad technical privileges such as deleting and protecting pages, blocking users and editing protected pages. The administrator status is obtained at the end of a process that starts with the person or another user submitting a Request For Adminship (RFA). The entire community then has about a week to cast a positive, negative or neutral vote accompanied by comments which fuel discussions around the candidate. Finally, the final decision to promote or not is made by users called bureaucrats. In the age of social media algorithms, online anonymity and insidious internet communication shenanigans, the different factors that can impact the discourse and voting behaviour of large masses of individuals over short periods of time in the context of limited information about candidates become important to investigate.

## Research Questions
- How does the positivity/negativity dimension of the public sentiment about a user change over time during an election?
- How does the positivity/negativity dimension of the public sentiment about returning candidates between elections?
- What are the consequences for candidates of having a bias for writing negative comments?
- What specific questions in the RFA voting form sway people
- What are the most importance topics for most users
- What are the important criteria for the voters

## Proposed Additional Dataset

We would like to include in the data used all of the discussion walls pertaining to the RFA votes in order to have more datapoints to examine. Indeed, this would provide a more precise and nuanced point view of the sentiment that voters have about candidates. Using the candidate names, time of posting and usernames, we could merge the long form comments written by users into the original dataset in order to make it more complete. An important step to perform on the global datasets, at least for the analyses which are based on the content of the short and long form comments, is to remove the entries where people either did not comment or commented something such as '-' and nothing else.

## Methods

- Remove the "no comment" entries
-
