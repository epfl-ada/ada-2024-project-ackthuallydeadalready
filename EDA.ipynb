Great that you want to help administering Wikipedia. Some areas here are, however, difficult to master, and mastering them will be what you have to achieve before your request will be granted. [[WP:CSD]] is a case in point, your tagging of [[Centre for Population, Poverty and Public Policy Studies]] today was substandard. It was neither G11 nor A7 as indicated by you. A single Google check would have brought up the required sources. In fact, after checking this article you should have removed the [[WP:PROD]] template.     1\n",
