                    <h2>Public sentiments on Wikipedia admins and their consequences in RfA elections: A deep dive into voting patterns, community behavior, and sentiment trends shaping the Wikipedia admin landscape.</h2>

                    <p>
                        Imagine a world where trust isn't just a virtue but a cornerstone of governance. 
                        On Wikipedia, the administrators, entrusted with safeguarding the platform's integrity, embark on a journey to earn this trust through a social consensus process called Request for Adminship (RfA). 
                        Unlike the conventional voting systems we encounter in politics or workplaces, the RfA is more than just a tally of yeses and nos. 
                        It's a nuanced conversation where every comment, question, and response shapes the community's decision.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now, what if we could peek into this dynamic process, unraveling the sentiments, themes, and turning points that sway opinions? Welcome to our project. 
                        By combining the art of sentiment analysis with cutting-edge natural language processing, we aim to decode the fabric of consensus-building in Wikipedia's admin elections. 
                        From policy stances to communication skills, we will uncover the topics that ignite the most spirited debates.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Join us as we explore the rich social dynamics of Wikipedia's RfA process, offering insights not just into the world of online governance but also into designing more effective systems of collective decision-making!

                    <h2>RfA Characterisation</h2>
                    <p>
                        The RfA (Request for Adminship) process is the cornerstone of how Wikipedia selects its administrators. 
                        To help you grasp the essence of these elections, we've visualized the intricate web of interactions that make up an RfA.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here's a graph representing the key players and their connections:
                    </p>

                    <object id="ridiculogram" type="text/html" data="https://epfl-ada.github.io/ada-2024-project-ackthuallydeadalready/res/images/connexion.webp" height="500px" width="100%">
                        <p>Unable to load graph</p>
                    </object>

                    <p>
                        Okay, we admit it—this graph looks a bit chaotic! Let us break it down for you!
                        Light blue nodes represent the participants and candidates, including voters who express their opinions through comments and votes, and each line represents a vote, with green lines for positive votes and red lines for negative votes.
                        Behind every line lies a wealth of discussion and debate, as users deliberate on the candidate's qualifications. 
                        These discussions, available on specific Wikipedia pages, are at the heart of the RfA process, shaping the opinions that drive each vote.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But what about the broader trends? 
                        How have the number of elections and their outcomes changed over the years? 
                        Let's take a step back from individual interactions and look at the bigger picture.

                    <p>
                        Before looking at the RFA elections data, let's quickly talk about Wikipedia. It was launched as a free-content encyclopedia which created 
                        and maintained articles through a community of volunteers. The platform went live when dot.com bubble burst and maintained relevance till today.
                        The project was interesting because of a simple mission to create freely accessible articles on topics. This community needs administrators who
                        are willing to devote their free time to maintain the common database. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the graph, we observe that there was a meteoric rise in RFA elections till 2007 which perhaps reflects the rising popularity of the platform
                        in the early 2000s. RFA elections peaked in 2007 during the Global Financial Crisis. Although, we can't say for sure, but perhaps the economic crisis
                        was an inflection point for volunteers as adminship requires a regular commitment. If admins to do not contribute regularly, they can be recalled 
                        (de-adminship). To put bluntly, volunteering became a luxury. Irrespective of the cause, we see that RFA elections consistently decline since the peak.
                        The decay persists to today. If we look at net additions/removals (table above), we notice that 2011 onwards, we see that removals dominate the additions
                        after the passing of the 2011 reform wich automatically desysop (remove) admins who aren't active for a year. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another interesting aspect are the pass rates. We see that they are quite high in the early years which reflect the hyper-growth stage which needs to
                        increase the ranks of the admins to meet the growing admin needs. As demand cools, we can see that pass rates stabilize between 35-50% which reflects
                        a more selective administration criteria. The 2011 reform changes the election dynamics for the following years. The trend is not very visible in this
                        graph, but if we look at a wikiepdia author's work, we see that the trend post-2011, we see that RFA passrates increased to 60-70%.

                        At first glance, there are two points which strike us: most people only run once, and those who fail on their first try, still have a chance
                        to become an admin. We see that an overwhelming majority (79%) of candidates will only run once and that the odds of succeeding are essentially 
                        a coin flip. However, the persistent few (21% overall) that are willing to through the election process, at least a second time, face stiff odds
                        to achieve administrator status. Only one in three of people who failed on their first attempt will eventually become administrators. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We've talked about candidates, but what about voters? Let's investigate if they have any positive or negative biases when evaluating candidates
                        try to join their ranks. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As we can see, our voters are a very positive bunch. In all years, positive votes are the overwheleming majority and our consistently between 
                        70 and 80 percent. Absentention are quite rare in elections which perhaps makes sense. If you take the time to evaluate the candidate's 
                        profile, it seems quite improbable that an admin would not have positive or negative opinion, but still vote. They constitute around 7% of votes
                        in each year but they have no real impact on elections. Lastly, Negative votes are consistently between a fifth or quarter of the overall votes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There's an obvious contradiction: how can voters vote overwhelmingly positive yet the pass rates are so low? A good first guess is that the 
                        positive and negative votes are not similarly distributed by elections. Put another way, we must surely have clustering of negative and positive
                        sentiment around specific candidates (i.e. good candidates and bad candidates).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In any election, a key factor for outcomes is voter participants. As more people vote, the importance of convincing more people grows. Hence,
                        the game shifts from convincing individuals to groups of people (i.e. communities with common voting behavior). Intuitively, the marginal value 
                        of each vote diminishes as the size of the election increases. To quickly illustrate this, let's consider two elections: one has two voters, the
                        other has four voters. In the former, swinging one vote in your favor would increase the positive votes by 50 percentage points. 
                        In the latter, swinging one vote would increase the positive votes by 25 percentage points, half as much. As average election sizes grew, candidates
                        need to earn the consensus of a larger population, likely with electoral factions. <a href="https://dioday45.github.io/TheDataFreaks/">Another ADA group</a> researched this and it is
                        possible that there exists certain communities which act as kingmakers in these elections. 
                    </p>

                        Building on our previous graphs, we can see that there's a rightward shift of elections which end with a win. As the years pass, elections with
                        more votes are more likely to end with a win. On the other end, we see that elections with fewer votes are mostly ending with losses. This is
                        perhaps counterintuitive, as smaller elections should be easier to win. However, low turnout is perhaps a kiss of death in the eyes of election officials
                        who determine the outcome. Lack of voter turnout could mean that the candidate lacks effective support from admins. In essence, we may be observing that
                        there's a minumum voter turnout threshold to secure the possibility of a win.

                        So far, we've explored the intricate mechanisms of the Request for Adminship (RfA) process, from the evolving trends in elections to the fascinating interplay of candidates, voters, and outcomes. 
                        But numbers and graphs can only take us so far. 
                        To truly understand the forces shaping RfA decisions, we must dive deeper—into the sentiments and perceptions that influence the community's voice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What drives a voter to support or oppose a candidate? 
                        Is it the candidate's track record, their responses to questions, or perhaps an intangible sense of trust conveyed in the discussions? 
                        By leveraging sentiment analysis, we can analyse the nuanced emotions that guide this unique consensus-building process.

                        With our sentiment analysis graphs in hand, we can now explore the relationship between community sentiment and the success rates of candidates in Wikipedia's RfA process. 
                        Using tools like HuggingFace and Vader, we categorized comments into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments and tried to visually correlated them with the outcomes of RfA elections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From both the HuggingFace and Vader analyses, we observe a clear trend: candidates receiving predominantly positive sentiment in the comments enjoy significantly higher success rates. 
                        This underscores the importance of perceived trustworthiness, collegiality, and alignment with community values during the RfA process. 
                        Positive comments often highlight qualities such as a strong track record, effective communication, and demonstrated commitment to the community—traits highly valued in administrators.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On the flip side, candidates facing a higher proportion of negative sentiment comments tend to struggle in securing the community's approval. 
                        Negative feedback often revolves around perceived lapses in judgment, contentious interactions, or a perceived lack of experience. 
                        Interestingly, even a small number of vocal dissenters can disproportionately affect the overall sentiment score, indicating that voters place significant weight on negative opinions.

                        The RfA process is more than just a vote; it's a conversation. 
                        Every comment, question, and response shapes the community's decision. 
                        Now, we want to dive deeper than just the discussion, but what exactly started the discussion. Before each and every voting, the 
                        candidate has to write a statement to present themselves to the community. This statement is the first impression that the community
                        has of the candidate. We want to analyze these statements to see what are the most common topics and sentiments expressed by the candidates.
                        These statements are usually made according to the guidelines with some specific topics that the candidates has to address. It is given to the
                        candidates through questions. Any approved editor can add optional question that the candidate can answer to further prove that they are indeed worthy of the adminship title. 
                        We believe these questions and answers are important in determining whether a candidate is going to pass because the final decision is not based on the vote itself,
                        but it is based on the bureaucrat's decision. To do this, we scraped all questions and answers from the users that have been elected to become an admin.
                        Now, let's take a look at the top 10 questions the candidate is asked.

                    <p>
                        Now, we can see from these how the community is interested in the candidate's past experiences and how they have dealt with conflicts in the past.
                        These are the cornerstone of what makes a great admin, contributions and how they have dealt with conflicts. These are the important question that the admin has
                        to be able to answer. Of course there are some other outliers question which are pretty popular as well such as: 
                    </p>
                        <table>
                            <tr><td>What is the difference between a ban and a block?</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>What is your opinion on the current BLP policy, and what work have you done (if any) with BLPs?</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>You find out that an editor, who's well-known and liked in the community, has been using sockpuppets abusively. What would you do?</td></tr>
                        </table>

                    <p>
                        These questions are made probably to assess the candidate's knowledge and
                        stand in the wikipedia operation. It is to see the character of the candidate and how they will be able to handle the adminship role. The question about hypothetical situation
                        is quite popular since it is usually specific to the user asking the question to assess the candidate's ability.

                        As we have seen, the questions are important, but what about the answers? We have scraped the answers as well and we have analyzed the sentiment of the answers.
                        Let's look at a sample of what we see are the most common form of answers in answering either contributions or conflicts.
                    </p>

                    <table>
                        <tr><td>I am very passionate about combating vandalism and biased material, so I plan to continue to help in that regard.</tr>
                        <tr><td>Mainly to combat vandalism accross Wikipedia and to maintain its integrity as user built encylopedia. With regards to the contents I will give imporance to layout. I have contributed various times to the afd project.</tr>
                        <tr><td>Fighting vandalizm on pages about _ and other things of my interests.</tr>
                    </table>

                    <p>
                        From all the answers that we see, it is mostly divided to 2: general and specifics. These are the form of generic answers regarding someone's motivation to become
                        an admin. It is usually about fighting against vandalism, maintaining the integrity of the platform, and contributing to the platform. Meanwhile, other specifics answer
                        are about the candidate's past experiences and how they have dealt with conflicts as well as the hypothetical questions. These are the most common form of answers that we see.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since we believe these questions and answers are very important in determining the outcome of the election, we have analyzed the sentiment and topics of the answers. We have used vader for sentiment analysis
                        and keyBERT for topic extraction in all the questions and answers. Let's see an example of the result for user with id BDD.

                        So from this example you can see the kind of questions and answers that we usually have in terms of wikipedia RfA process. It usually starts with quite a general questions regarding the user
                        and slowly becoming more and more specific about their experience. In a sense, sometimes it is stricter than a job interview. Your whole editing and past history will be brought up before you
                        and this will be the deciding factor in determining whether someone will or will not be an admin.

                        Now, these topics are quite interesting in and of itself, so we decided to aggregate the topics and combine it with the discussion forum to see how they match and how these 
                        'seed' topics would guide the discussion forum. To do this, we use the questions and answers topics and see how many of them are mentioned again in the discussion forum and
                        how many times are those topics mentioned. Let's take a look at the results.

                        THese topics are quite interesting as they show the most common topics that are discussed in the RfA process. The topics itself are sometimes too generic to be understood easily.
                        However, if we take a bit of a deeper look, we would understand the significance of these topics. For example, topics such as contributions, editing, conflicts, and vandalism show
                        the most common topics that are discussed in the RfA process. These topics show what the community is interested in and what they are looking for in an admin. We can also see how both the
                        topics in the questions and answers and the discussion forum are quite similar. The questions and answers do indeed provide a good direction for the discussion.

                        One interesting topic is vandalism, it is quite a specific topic that is discussed in the RfA process. This is interesting because it shows how vandalism is a common problem in the wikipedia.
                        Now if we plot this in a bar graph over the year in the discussion, we will see how the problem is addressed in the wikipedia community. This also shows how the selection of admin
                        is always changing throughout the year, not focused on a single qualification. One time, understanding how to manage vandalism might be a huge plus in the discussion, but at some point, it 
                        will be another skillset that is just required. As we can see in the graph, the vandalism topic increased and decreased over time. The community might have selected enough people 
                        who are able to manage vandalism and thus the topic is not discussed as much in the later years.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These kinds of insight are what makes the topic analysis within a discussion so interesting. If we dig deeper, it might be possible to understand other qualifications that is important in certain
                        election years. This information might prove useful for people who are trying to win the election.
