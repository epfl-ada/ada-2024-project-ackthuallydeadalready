                    <h2>Public sentiments on Wikipedia admins and their consequences in RfA elections: A deep dive into voting patterns, community behavior, and sentiment trends shaping the Wikipedia admin landscape.</h2>

                    <p>
                        Imagine a world where trust isn't just a virtue but a cornerstone of governance. 
                        On Wikipedia, the administrators, entrusted with safeguarding the platform's integrity, embark on a journey to earn this trust through a social consensus process called Request for Adminship (RfA). 
                        Unlike the conventional voting systems we encounter in politics or workplaces, the RfA is more than just a tally of yeses and nos. 
                        It's a nuanced conversation where every comment, question, and response shapes the community's decision.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now, what if we could peek into this dynamic process, unraveling the sentiments, themes, and turning points that sway opinions? Welcome to our project. 
                        By combining the art of sentiment analysis with cutting-edge natural language processing, we aim to decode the fabric of consensus-building in Wikipedia's admin elections. 
                        From policy stances to communication skills, we will uncover the topics that ignite the most spirited debates.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Join us as we explore the rich social dynamics of Wikipedia's RfA process, offering insights not just into the world of online governance but also into designing more effective systems of collective decision-making!

                    <p>
                        The RfA (Request for Adminship) process is the cornerstone of how Wikipedia selects its administrators. 
                        To help you grasp the essence of these elections, we've visualized the intricate web of interactions that make up an RfA.

                    <p>
                        Here's a graph representing the key players and their connections:
                    </p>

                    <object id="ridiculogram" type="text/html" data="https://epfl-ada.github.io/ada-2024-project-ackthuallydeadalready/res/images/connexion.webp" height="500px" width="100%">

                    <p>
                        Okay, we admit it—this graph looks a bit chaotic! Let us break it down for you!
                        Light blue nodes represent the participants and candidates, including voters who express their opinions through comments and votes, and each line represents a vote, with green lines for positive votes and red lines for negative votes.
                        Behind every line lies a wealth of discussion and debate, as users deliberate on the candidate's qualifications. 
                        These discussions, available on specific Wikipedia pages, are at the heart of the RfA process, shaping the opinions that drive each vote.

                    <p>
                        But what about the broader trends? 
                        How have the number of elections and their outcomes changed over the years? 
                        Let's take a step back from individual interactions and look at the bigger picture.

                    <p>
                        Before looking at the RFA elections data, let's quickly talk about Wikipedia. It was launched as a free-content encyclopedia which created 
                        and maintained articles through a community of volunteers. The platform went live when dot.com bubble burst and maintained relevance till today.
                        The project was interesting because of a simple mission to create freely accessible articles on topics. This community needs administrators who
                        are willing to devote their free time to maintain the common database. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the graph, we observe that there was a meteoric rise in RFA elections till 2007 which perhaps reflects the rising popularity of the platform
                        in the early 2000s. RFA elections peaked in 2007 during the Global Financial Crisis. Although, we can't say for sure, but perhaps the economic crisis
                        was an inflection point for volunteers as adminship requires a regular commitment. If admins to do not contribute regularly, they can be recalled 
                        (de-adminship). To put bluntly, volunteering became a luxury. Irrespective of the cause, we see that RFA elections consistently decline since the peak.
                        The decay persists to today. If we look at net additions/removals (add graph), we notice that 2011 onwards, we see that removals dominate the additions
                        after the passing of the 2011 reform wich automatically desysop (remove) admins who aren't active for a year. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another interesting aspect are the pass rates. We see that they are quite high in the early years which reflect the hyper-growth stage which needs to
                        increase the ranks of the admins to meet the growing admin needs. As demand cools, we can see that pass rates stabilize between 35-50% which reflects
                        a more selective administration criteria. The 2011 reform changes the election dynamics for the following years. The trend is not very visible in this
                        graph, but if we look at a wikiepdia author's work, we see that the trend post-2011, we see that RFA passrates increased to 60-70%.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At first glance, there are two points which strike us: most people only run once, and those who fail on their first try, still have a chance
                        to become an admin. We see that an overwhelming majority (79%) of candidates will only run once and that the odds of succeeding are essentially 
                        a coin flip. However, the persistent few (21% overall) that are willing to through the election process, at least a second time, face stiff odds
                        to achieve administrator status. Only one in three of people who failed on their first attempt will eventually become administrators. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We've talked about candidates, but what about voters? Let's investigate if they have any positive or negative biases when evaluating candidates
                        try to join their ranks.

                    <p>
                        As we can see, our voters are very positive bunch. In all years, positive votes are the overwheleming majority and our consistently between 
                        70 and 80 percent. Absentention are quite rare in elections which perhaps makes sense. If you take the time to evaluate the candidate's 
                        profile, it seems quite improbable that an admin would not have positive or negative opinion, but still vote. They constitute around 7% of votes
                        in each year but they have no real impact on elections. Lastly, Negative votes are consistently between a fifth or quarter of the overall votes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There's an obvious contradiction: how can voters vote overwhelmingly positive yet the pass rates are so low? A good first guess is that the 
                        positive and negative votes are not similarly distributed by elections. Put another way, we must surely have clustering of negative and positive
                        sentiment around specific candidates (i.e. good candidates and bad candidates).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In any election, a key factor for outcomes is voter participants. As more people vote, the importance of convincing more people grows. Hence,
                        the game shifts from convincing individuals to groups of people (i.e. communities with common voting behavior). Intuitively, the marginal value 
                        of each vote diminishes as the size of the election increases. To quickly illustrate this, let's consider two elections: one has two voters, the
                        other has four voters. In the former, swinging one vote in your favor would increase the positive votes by 50 percentage points. 
                        In the latter, swinging one vote would increase the positive votes by 25 percentage points, half as much. As average election sizes grew, candidates
                        need to earn the consensus of a larger population, likely with electoral factions. <a href="https://dioday45.github.io/TheDataFreaks/">Another ADA group</a> researched this and it is
                        possible that there exists certain communities which act as kingmakers in these elections.

                        Building on our previous graphs, we can see that there's a rightward shift of elections which end with a win. As the years pass, elections with
                        more votes are more likely to end with a win. On the other end, we see that elections with fewer votes are mostly ending with losses. This is
                        perhaps counterintuitive, as smaller elections should be easier to win. However, low turnout is perhaps a kiss of death in the eyes of election officials
                        who determine the outcome. Lack of voter turnout could mean that the candidate lacks effective support from admins. In essence, we may be observing that
                        there's a minumum voter turnout threshold to secure the possibility of a win.
