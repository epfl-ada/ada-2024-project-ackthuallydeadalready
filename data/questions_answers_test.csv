BDD$ What administrative work do you intend to take part in?$I primarily intend to work on the RM backlog and administer XfDs, especially RfD and AfD. I'd also like to keep CSD and PROD flowing nicely. I can't think of any administrative tasks I'd be uncomfortable performing or unwilling to tackle; I do want to start off with work I'm already familiar with.
BDD$ What are your best contributions to Wikipedia, and why?$I wasn't quite sure what say here. I'm really a generalist, both on Wikipedia and in my professional life. I tell people, half jokingly, that as a librarian it's my job to organize and classify topics I know nothing about. But I really enjoy that sort of thing, whether it's applying detailed Library of Congress Subject Headings to a book on electrical engineering or copy editing articles on cities in India I had never heard of before. I joined WikiProject Idaho a few days ago, but until then, my only affiliations were with WikiProjects Merge and Redirect, plus the Guild of Copy Editors. Creating articles can be a delight. Most that I've created are fairly short, though I am proud of Pro-Life (politician)See below and 007 (Shanty Town). But I really like behind-the-scenes sort of work. I think it's become very sexy these days to identify as a WikiGnome, but this is often how I approach the project, and I think the mop is a good fit for this sort of disposition generally.\nAddendum: This was a serious yet honest omission. I'm not the original creator of the Pro-Life article. The article was deleted at AfD in 2008, an administrator restored it for me, and I essentially rewrote it. But it's not entirely correct to suggest I was the article's original creator. Judge for yourself: here's the article at deletion versus its current state. I am proud of this work, but I must acknowledge the work done by others as well. That's the Wikipedia way.
BDD$ Have you been in any conflicts over editing in the past or have other users caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future?$Generally speaking, I haven't really gotten involved in any edit wars. One aspect of my gnomish tendencies is that I really don't get very emotional with my edits. I very rarely watchlist articles just because I've added something to them; I generally am willing to give the benefit of the doubt to whoever might make a decision to remove my addition.\nThe only time I've really come close to 3RR in recent memory was with Pro-Life (politician). I wanted a See also section pointing to Se\u00e1n Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus, another politician who changed his name to call attention to a pet issue, and I wanted Loftus's article to have a complementary See also. Another editor (who I notice has since been sanctioned for edit warring) reverted my additions, we talked it over on talk pages, and he or she basically just gave up and let it stand. But we were close to 3RR, and if the other editor hadn't given in, I would've done so and wouldn't really have felt upset over it.\nEvery now and then I get worked up when I feel like policies or guidelines are being ignored in favor of personal preference. I'm not proud of how I basically freaked out at the discussion in this RM. That said, I abided by the ultimate decision, cooled down, and didn't do anything crazy over it. You can't expect an editor to never get emotional, but when the dispute doesn't carry over into other areas of the encyclopedia, I don't think these types of disagreements do any real damage. I don't deny having strong opinions about certain issues, but I just don't let that override the consensus-building process. I'll always advocate reform of WP:USPLACE, for example, when it comes to an RFC, but I'm never going to make disruptive RMs or otherwise ignore USPLACE while it stands.
BDD$" One of your opinions is that ""notability can absolutely be temporary"". Have you been in AfDs where this consideration has affected your vote? How would this opinion affect your closure decision in AfD's?"$"That's a tough one. I think this is one of the areas where Wikipedia policies and guidelines at least rub against each other, if not actually contradict. WP:NTEMP says notability is not temporary. That's a pretty strong statement. We can at least say little-n notability is temporary (cf. 15 minutes of fame). But even big-n, Wikipedia Notability can be temporary. WP:NOTNEWSPAPER urges us to consider \""the enduring notability of persons and events.\"" To some extent, that's a directive to engage in speculation. Wikipedia can be a fantastic resource for current events, some of which are very obviously notable, such as major terrorist attacks or political scandals. In fact, I can pinpoint one of the exact moments when I really came to believe in Wikipedia. It happens to have been eight years ago to the day, when Pope Benedict XVI was named. I hadn't seen the news anywhere else, and this is even more impressive in hindsight, as Wikipedia in April 2005 was a very different beast than today, and usually not for the better.\nI suspect most editors would love to break a scoop like that, and that contributes to a zeal for coverage of current events. But I think a lot of dross is created in this process. When I vote on such articles at AfD, I tend towards advocating deletion. As I expressed alongside that opinion you refer to, there's no end of news events of yesteryear that could have articles if Wikipedia had been around in the 20th century, for example. And while I know we don't need to worry about having too many articles or anything, I think we'd be cluttered with ephemera that really only indicate a brief flash of interest. And I think there's a difference between topics like that and obscure topics that really do have a non-temporary sort of notability, such as J. Hamilton Lewis, one of my early creations.\nIn summary, I think Wikipedia documentation is like the US Constitution. It's vague, but it's probably best that way so editors' discretion can prevail in the many gray areas. As for closing AfDs, there's nothing I can say besides that my goal will only be assessing consensus among participating editors. If consensus isn't clear, I'll participate in the discussion myself or leave it for someone else to close. I'm not going to tear up news articles based on my personal opinions."
BDD$" You once had your own Five Pillars on your user page, but you removed them because you now think of them as ""dumb"". One of these pillars was: ""Full inclusion of the arcane - if you can write an article based on actual medieval writings dealing with the properties of and legends surrouding Satan's left big-toe toenail (but please cite your sources!)."" Has your thinking on this changed?"$Haha, yes indeed. As Steel1943 mentioned, I've had an account for a long time, even though I've only been highly active for a bit over a year. I was in high school when I wrote that, and I removed it at one point when I recognized how ridiculous it was. I participated in a few deletion discussions back there, but I'm not sure I ever actually looked at a policy page. My user page was quite silly when I was younger, and I'm not sure it could've passed through MfD entirely intact if it had been so challenged. I could generously be described as an inclusionist then, and to some extent, I think the whole project was. I don't particularly associate myself with any such labels at this point. But no, you're not going to see me making that link blue anytime soon.
BDD$ Have you ever edited WP under any other user name or names? If so, what were these?$No, not under any other user names. I probably made a few IP edits in high school before I created my account, and I've occasionally probed article histories in search of such edits just for curiosity's sake. I haven't found them, but they may not exist.
BDD$" Your contribution history is interesting, showing just a few edits each month for years and years, sometimes falling to zero, but usually just picking along. Then, starting in February 2012 we see a move to ""very active editing,"" and an escalation in subsequent months. What changed about you or about Wikipedia for you in that period? Are there lessons for us all in your own personal experience about how to turn occasional editors into serious Wikipedians?"$"Hm. It never occurred to me that my experience might have lessons for reversing editor decline. I don't know how much I can offer, though. I rarely edited in college and grad school, and to some extent I feel I have more free time as a professional. I think Wikipedia is just a very good fit for my professional interests. Library school these days has a real focus on digital information, and Wikipedia's mission strongly resembles those of most libraries.\nIf there's anything in my experience that can be helpful to other editors, it's that once I really started to feel like part of the community, I felt more personally invested in the project. RM really did that for me, because there's definitely a gang of \""usual suspects\"" that regularly combs the list and offers opinions. I don't think we should become a social network or anything, but enhancing interaction and creating bonds between editors could definitely enhance content creation, not distract from it."
BDD$ You indicate an interest in helping out with deletion closures, which I think is a good thing u2014 we do need more dedicated closers at AfD. I see nothing in your AfD track record that is particularly concerning I will note. I would like your opinion on the Keep/Redirect consensus that has emerged at AfD with respect to articles on schools. Do you believe in the wisdom of this consensus and will you support it in your closes? Or do you find it troubling that the actual working consensus on these matters is somewhat different than the written guideline of GNG?$That's not a topic I've given a great deal of thought to. The school consensus is refreshing in that it has very clear divisions as to what's notable and what's not, but that's really not how notability is determined. From my own perspective, what makes a high school of a thousand students notable compared to a library branch that may serve tens of thousands? I think a change in that consensus would be smart, but I'd prefer to see it done with an RFC or something. There's no sense in just trying to fight out something on every new school AfD.
BDD$ Since you started logging your CSD tags in January, you've only tagged 20 articles. You have only a 72% !vote to consensus outcome percentage at AFD, and you've only participated in 30 AFD discussions in the last 4 months. Many, including myself, would not considering this to be much experience at all, and possibly the area you're the least experienced in of all the areas you do participate. You cite CSD and AFD as the main areas of adminship duties you'd like to participate in. Could you please explain why you feel you have enough experience to be working in these areas?$I perhaps thought this would go without saying, but I suppose that was too big an assumption on my part. WP:BEBOLD is terrific advice for the reticent editor who needs encouragement to fully share his or her talents, but I think it's terrible advice for new administrators, especially when it comes to deletion. That's a recipe for disaster. If confirmed as an administrator, I very much intend to delete conservatively until I'm sure I know what I'm doing. I'm not sure how many CSDs I tagged before I enabled logging (though probably not many), but I think I've shown good judgment with what I have tagged. Of the three bluelinks there, there's a dab that was recreated once its listed articles were created, a new dab that replaced a promotional webpage, and a redirect from a semi-notable band. My PROD log is even smaller, but the only blue link there was a complete rewrite compared to what I tagged.\nI know from my RM experience how to assess consensus, and again, I'm not going to jump right in to try to close the most contentious discussions. On a practical note, I currently live in the Pacific Time Zone, making me among the last Wikipedia editors to wake up each day. When I first look at the AfDs closing on a given day, the majority are already closed, some by non-admins. Much of what's left are clear delete outcomes simply awaiting administrator attention. In the long run, those certainly aren't the only sort of discussions I intend to close. But I think that's a good place to start. For what it's worth, I listed my interests in question 1 from approximately most to least interest. In the past couple of months I've been at RfD much more than AfD, and if confirmed, you can expect my administrative work to proceed accordingly.\nI'm sure the delete button is very exciting for many new administrators, but I want to make clear that I'm not here on a power trip. I first took up admin-like duties at RM simply because I saw a formidable backlog that I could help with. Now, I just want a few more tools to make my work more effective. If you think I'll abuse those tools, I'd certainly understand your position. If not, I hope you'll reconsider.
BDD$ Carrite has asked you a similar question but this isn't covered. While you have been editing for eight years, a year ago you still had fewer than 3000 edits. Only beginning in February 2012, your monthly edit counts has increased. How would you assure us that your edit counts are unlikely to fall as rapidly as they increased?$I can't predict the future, of course, but I do think recent history is more reflective of my overall commitment to the project. Most of those barren years were in college and graduate school. I'm not going to be the same person for the rest of my life, but I think it's fair to say I'll look more like I do now than I did then. And looking at overall trends, I've generally become more active as time goes on. I'm invested in the project in a way I've never been before, so while the question is certainly fair, I personally don't foresee myself lapsing back into inactivity.
BDD$ What are your overall impressions and opinions about the state of WikiProjects and Portals on English Wikipedia at this time?$My impression of WikiProjects is that many more are inactive in practice than only those tagged as such. I think that's a shame\u2014I believe WikiProjects can be great ways to organize groups of editors with common interests to improve relevant articles and to serve as a source of expertise, sort of specialized reference desks, for issues other editors run into. I've left messages on talk pages of a dozen WikiProjects or so, with varying results. In several cases, I was clearly talking to myself. But in others, I found active, helpful groups of editors who left me with very positive impressions. WikiProject Military history, in particular, I've found to be a fantastic group that demonstrates what WikiProjects can achieve, and why they're a great idea. But many, many projects don't even come close to this level. I think the main reason I've been conservative about joining WikiProjects is that if I don't feel I can really do my part to help that project work towards that WPMH ideal, I'm really just wasting everyone's time. I'd rather see a project or task force with three highly dedicated editors than one with a long list of supposedly interested parties that just don't do anything.\nAs for portals, well, I've hardly ever visited one. I can see where they'd be useful for some readers, but they don't interest me personally.\nThanks for providing your perspective and viewpoints; it is appreciated.
