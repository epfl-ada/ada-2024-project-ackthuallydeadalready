      "Question:  What administrative work do you intend to take part in?\\n, answer: A: I primarily intend to work on the RM backlog and administer XfDs, especially RfD and AfD. I'd also like to keep CSD and PROD flowing nicely. I can't think of any administrative tasks I'd be uncomfortable performing or unwilling to tackle; I do want to start off with work I'm already familiar with.\n",
      "Question:  What are your best contributions to Wikipedia, and why?\\n, answer: A: I wasn't quite sure what say here. I'm really a generalist, both on Wikipedia and in my professional life. I tell people, half jokingly, that as a librarian it's my job to organize and classify topics I know nothing about. But I really enjoy that sort of thing, whether it's applying detailed Library of Congress Subject Headings to a book on electrical engineering or copy editing articles on cities in India I had never heard of before. I joined WikiProject Idaho a few days ago, but until then, my only affiliations were with WikiProjects Merge and Redirect, plus the Guild of Copy Editors. Creating articles can be a delight. Most that I've created are fairly short, though I am proud of Pro-Life (politician)See below and 007 (Shanty Town). But I really like behind-the-scenes sort of work. I think it's become very sexy these days to identify as a WikiGnome, but this is often how I approach the project, and I think the mop is a good fit for this sort of disposition generally.\\nAddendum: This was a serious yet honest omission. I'm not the original creator of the Pro-Life article. The article was deleted at AfD in 2008, an administrator restored it for me, and I essentially rewrote it. But it's not entirely correct to suggest I was the article's original creator. Judge for yourself: here's the article at deletion versus its current state. I am proud of this work, but I must acknowledge the work done by others as well. That's the Wikipedia way.\n",
      "Question:  Have you been in any conflicts over editing in the past or have other users caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future?\\n, answer: A: Generally speaking, I haven't really gotten involved in any edit wars. One aspect of my gnomish tendencies is that I really don't get very emotional with my edits. I very rarely watchlist articles just because I've added something to them; I generally am willing to give the benefit of the doubt to whoever might make a decision to remove my addition.\\nThe only time I've really come close to 3RR in recent memory was with Pro-Life (politician). I wanted a See also section pointing to Se\\u00e1n Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus, another politician who changed his name to call attention to a pet issue, and I wanted Loftus's article to have a complementary See also. Another editor (who I notice has since been sanctioned for edit warring) reverted my additions, we talked it over on talk pages, and he or she basically just gave up and let it stand. But we were close to 3RR, and if the other editor hadn't given in, I would've done so and wouldn't really have felt upset over it.\\nEvery now and then I get worked up when I feel like policies or guidelines are being ignored in favor of personal preference. I'm not proud of how I basically freaked out at the discussion in this RM. That said, I abided by the ultimate decision, cooled down, and didn't do anything crazy over it. You can't expect an editor to never get emotional, but when the dispute doesn't carry over into other areas of the encyclopedia, I don't think these types of disagreements do any real damage. I don't deny having strong opinions about certain issues, but I just don't let that override the consensus-building process. I'll always advocate reform of WP:USPLACE, for example, when it comes to an RFC, but I'm never going to make disruptive RMs or otherwise ignore USPLACE while it stands.\n",
      "Question:  One of your opinions is that \\\"notability can absolutely be temporary\\\". Have you been in AfDs where this consideration has affected your vote? How would this opinion affect your closure decision in AfD's?\\n, answer: A: That's a tough one. I think this is one of the areas where Wikipedia policies and guidelines at least rub against each other, if not actually contradict. WP:NTEMP says notability is not temporary. That's a pretty strong statement. We can at least say little-n notability is temporary (cf. 15 minutes of fame). But even big-n, Wikipedia Notability can be temporary. WP:NOTNEWSPAPER urges us to consider \\\"the enduring notability of persons and events.\\\" To some extent, that's a directive to engage in speculation. Wikipedia can be a fantastic resource for current events, some of which are very obviously notable, such as major terrorist attacks or political scandals. In fact, I can pinpoint one of the exact moments when I really came to believe in Wikipedia. It happens to have been eight years ago to the day, when Pope Benedict XVI was named. I hadn't seen the news anywhere else, and this is even more impressive in hindsight, as Wikipedia in April 2005 was a very different beast than today, and usually not for the better.\\nI suspect most editors would love to break a scoop like that, and that contributes to a zeal for coverage of current events. But I think a lot of dross is created in this process. When I vote on such articles at AfD, I tend towards advocating deletion. As I expressed alongside that opinion you refer to, there's no end of news events of yesteryear that could have articles if Wikipedia had been around in the 20th century, for example. And while I know we don't need to worry about having too many articles or anything, I think we'd be cluttered with ephemera that really only indicate a brief flash of interest. And I think there's a difference between topics like that and obscure topics that really do have a non-temporary sort of notability, such as J. Hamilton Lewis, one of my early creations.\\nIn summary, I think Wikipedia documentation is like the US Constitution. It's vague, but it's probably best that way so editors' discretion can prevail in the many gray areas. As for closing AfDs, there's nothing I can say besides that my goal will only be assessing consensus among participating editors. If consensus isn't clear, I'll participate in the discussion myself or leave it for someone else to close. I'm not going to tear up news articles based on my personal opinions.\n",
      "Question:  You once had your own Five Pillars on your user page, but you removed them because you now think of them as \\\"dumb\\\". One of these pillars was: \\\"Full inclusion of the arcane - if you can write an article based on actual medieval writings dealing with the properties of and legends surrouding Satan's left big-toe toenail (but please cite your sources!).\\\" Has your thinking on this changed?\\n, answer: A: Haha, yes indeed. As Steel1943 mentioned, I've had an account for a long time, even though I've only been highly active for a bit over a year. I was in high school when I wrote that, and I removed it at one point when I recognized how ridiculous it was. I participated in a few deletion discussions back there, but I'm not sure I ever actually looked at a policy page. My user page was quite silly when I was younger, and I'm not sure it could've passed through MfD entirely intact if it had been so challenged. I could generously be described as an inclusionist then, and to some extent, I think the whole project was. I don't particularly associate myself with any such labels at this point. But no, you're not going to see me making that link blue anytime soon.\n"

      "ANSWER:  A: I haven't been to RfA before, because my focus has always been on writing and referencing - I was worried that admin work would mean I would have less time to work on articles. However, I've been finding that my background means that I can help out with copyright violations, and it is an area which is both much needed and always in need of assistance. So my main area will be at CCI. That said, there are other jobs where I hope I can assist, especially in areas where a quick response is needed, so I'll turn up here and there if I can be of use.\\nIn regard to CCI, (which I should have linked to: WP:Contributor copyright investigations), the main role for the bit is to delete unsalvageable articles that contain significant copyright violations under G12, or to delete revisions containing copyright violations where those revisions can be removed without losing other content. Once a CCI is opened the issue is simply cleaning up the articles where needed, where the first choice is to salvage content if you can, but permanently remove it if you can't. Non-admins can do a lot of this, but in the end we have to delete pages or revisions where they can't be fixed.\\nJust to clarify, because it was raised below, there are two stages in a CCI. The first is the investigation, when we determine if there is a problem to pursue. While I guess tools could be handy, it isn't an area with a major backlog. The second, which is where the huge backlog sits, is in cleaning up through the CCIs and articles raised on Wikipedia:Copyright problems. While the term CCI sounds like it is an investigation of the contributor, once open it is better seen as investigating and fixing the contributions, and in that process our interest is in live edits.\n"

    "We use hugging face model to perform the anlysis on 10% of our dataset (just to show the feasibility). We are exploring the model right now and choosing which one we can efficiently use and have better accuracy in this scenario. Right now, the huggingface model just helps with the preprocessing we need to advance to the next step. But, the goal is to accurately get the intensity data of the sentiment analysis instead of just 0 and 1, that is the important part in this step (we tried using VADER as well with polarity scores but hugging face model performs better). We will improve this in the future with better model and more robust classification to indicate the intensity we need."
